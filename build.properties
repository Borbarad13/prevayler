# The value of the build.sysclasspath property control how the system classpath,
# ie. the classpath in effect when Ant is run, affects the behaviour of classpaths
# in Ant. The default behavior varies from Ant to Ant task.
# OPTIONS:
#  1. only   - Only the system classpath is used and classpaths specified in build
#              files, etc are ignored. This situation could be considered as the person
#              running the build file knows more about the environment than the person
#              writing the build file.
#  2. ignore - The system classpath is ignored. This situation is the reverse of the
#              above. The person running the build trusts the build file writer to
#              get the build file right.
#  3. last   - The classpath is concatenated to any specified classpaths at the end.
#              This is a compromise, where the build file writer has priority.
#  4. first  - Any specified classpaths are concatenated to the system classpath.
#              This is the other form of compromise where the build runner has priority.
# Niether "only" nor "ignore" will work.  "last" is the default here.  "first"
# would probably also work.
