  - Atomicity
  - Consistency - Transaction Filtering
  - Isolation
  - Durability - Persistence
 - Transparent Replication. Enables Fault-Tolerance and Load-Balancing.


Performance Scalability

 - Transaction Performance Scalability - Transaction processing is in the same order 


Architecture
================
How it works. The logging. The snapshots. Replication. Enables Fault-Tolerance and Load-Balancing.
