Requirements
================
Prevayler requires Java 1.2 or greater.
The GUIs for some of Prevayler's demo applications require Java 1.3 or greater.

This version of Prevayler was tested using JDK1.3.1_01.


Build Procedure
===================
To build and run Prevayler you compile the source code directly. This ensures maximum JDK compatibility.


Main Prevayler Classes
==========================
The following classes have the main() method and can be run directly. They are self explanatory.

1) org.prevayler.demos.demo1.Main - A tiny application that calculates prime numbers and stores them using Prevayler.

2) org.prevayler.demo.PrevaylerDemo - A bank application using Prevayler. Requires Java 1.3 or greater because of the GUI classes used.

3) org.prevayler.test.scalability.ScalabilityTest - Runs manipulation and query scalability tests against Prevayler and any JDBC database. Just follow the instructions.

4) org.prevayler.test.FullTest - The functional tests used to test Prevayler during development.


More Learning Resources
===========================
1) Javadoc - Included in this distribution.

2) Source Code - Prevayler's implementation (org.prevayler.implementation) has less than 300 statements.

3) http://www.prevayler.org - Access to all other Prevayler resources.
