Plan items for 2.0

- Finish failover support with multiple Prevaylers / multiple JVMs 

- Resolve the ClockedTransaction / ClockedActor issue 

- Add a (possibly optional) Transaction queue in front of Prevayler that 
lets us batch Transaction log writes along the lines of the discussion at 
http://www.prevayler.org/wiki.jsp?topic=OvercomingTheWriteBottleneck.

- Remove the TODO items listed in the TransactionLogger source code
