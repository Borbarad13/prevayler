</FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#000080"><P>Question: RAM is getting cheaper every day. Researchers are announcing major breakthroughs in memory technology. Even today, servers with multi-gigabyte RAM are commonplace. For many systems, it's already feasible to keep all business objects in RAM. Why can't I simply do that and forget all the database hassle?</P>
</B></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>Answer: You can, actually.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#000080"><P>Are you crazy? What if there's a system crash?</P>
</B></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>To avoid losing data, every night your system server saves a snapshot of all business objects to a file using plain object serialization.&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#000080"><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>What about the changes occurred since the last snapshot was taken? Won't the system lose those in a crash?</P>
</B></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>No.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#000080"><P>How come?</P>
</B></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>All commands received from the system's clients are converted into serializable objects by the server. Before being applied to the business objects, each command is serialized and written to a log file. During crash recovery, first, the system retrieves its last saved state from the snapshot file. Then, it reads the commands from the log files created since the snapshot was taken. These commands are simply applied to the business objects exactly as if they had just come from the system's clients. The system is then back in the state it was just before the crash and is ready to run.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#000080"><P>Does that mean my business objects have to be deterministic?</P>
</B></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>Yes. They must always produce the same state given the same commands.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#000080"><P>Doesn't the system have to enter read-only mode in order to produce a consistent snapshot?</P>
</B></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>No. That is a fundamental problem with transparent or orthogonal persistence projects like PJama (http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/pjava/) but it can be solved simply by having all system commands queued and routed through a single place. This enables the system to have a replica of the business logic on another virtual machine. All commands applied to the "hot" system are also read by the replica and applied in the exact same order. At backup time, the replica stops reading the commands and its snapshot is safely taken. After that, the replica continues reading the command queue and gets back in sync with the "hot" system.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#000080"><P>Doesn't that replica give me fault-tolerance as a bonus?</P>
</B></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>Yes it does. I have mentioned one but you can have several replicas. If the "hot" system crashes, any other replica can be elected and take over. Of course, you must be able to afford a machine for every replica you want.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#000080">Does this whole scheme have a name?</P>
</B></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>Yes. It is called system prevalence. It encompasses transparent persistence, fault-tolerance and load-balancing.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#000080"><P>If all my objects stay in RAM, will I be able to use SQL-based tools to query my objects'</I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2> </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#000080">attributes?</P>
</B></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>No. You will be able to use object-based tools. The good news is you will no longer be breaking your objects' encapsulation.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#000080"><P>What about transactions? Don't I need transactions?</P>
</B></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>No. The prevalence design gives you all transactional properties without the need for explicit transaction semantics in your code.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#000080"><P>How is that?</P>
</B></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>DBMSs tend to support only a few basic operations: INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE, for example. Because of this limitation, you must use transaction semantics (begin - commit) to delimit the operations in every business transaction for the benefit of your DBMS. In the prevalent design, every transaction is represented as a serializable object which is atomically written to the queue (a simple log file) and processed by the system. An object, or object graph, is enough to encapsulate the complexity of any business transaction.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#000080"><P>What about business rules involving dates and time? Won't all those replicas get out of sync?</P>
</B></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>No. If you ask the use-case gurus, they will tell you: "The clock is an external actor to the system.". This means that clock ticks are commands to the business objects and are sequentially applied to all replicas, just like all other commands.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#000080"><P>Is object prevalence faster than using a database?</P>
</B></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>The objects are always in RAM, already in their native form. No disk access or data marshalling is required. No persistence hooks placed by preprocessors or postprocessors are required in your code. No "isDirty" flag. No restrictions. You can use whatever algorithms and data-structures your language can support. Things don't get much faster than that.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#000080"><P>Besides being deterministic and serializable, what are the coding standards or restrictions my business classes have to obey?</P>
</B></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>None whatsoever. To issue commands to your business objects, though, each command must be represented as a serializable object. Typically, you will have one class for each use-case in your system.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#000080"><P>How scalable is object prevalence?</P>
</B></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>The persistence processes run completely in parallel with the business logic. While one command is being processed by the system, the next one is already being written to the log. Multiple log files can be used to increase throughput. The periodic writing of the snapshot file by the replica does not disturb the "hot" system in the slightest. Of course, tests must be carried out to determine the actual scalability of any given implementation but, in most cases, overall system scalability is bound by the scalability of the business classes themselves.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#000080"><P>Can't I use all those replicas to speed things up?</P>
</B></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>All replicas have to process all commands issued to the system. There is no great performance gain, therefore, in adding replicas to command-intensive systems. In query-intensive systems such as most Web applications, on the other hand, every new replica will boost the system because queries are transparently balanced between all available replicas. To enable that, though, just like your commands, each query to your business logic must also be represented as a serializable object.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#000080"><P>Isn't representing every system query as a serializable object a real pain?</P>
</B></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>That's only necessary if you want transparent load-balancing, mind you. Besides, the queries for most distributed applications arrive in a serializable form anyway. Take Web applications for example: aren't HTTP request strings serializable already?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#000080">Does prevalence only work in Java?</P>
</B></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>No. You can use any language for which you are able to find or build a serialization mechanism. In languages where you can directly access the system's memory and if the business objects are held in a specific memory segment, you can also write that segment out to the snapshot file instead of using serialization.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#000080"><P>Is there a Java implementation I can use?</P>
</B></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>Yes. You will find Prevayler - The Open-Source Prevalence Layer, an example application and more information at http://www.prevayler.org. It does not yet implement automatic load-balancing but it does implement transparent business object persistence and replication is in the oven.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#000080"><P>Is Prevayler reliable?</P>
</B></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>Prevayler's robustness comes from its simplicity. It is orders of magnitude simpler than the simplest RDBMS. Although I wouldn't use Prevayler to control a nuclear plant just yet, its open-source license ensures the whole of the software developing community the ability to scrutinize, optimize and extend Prevayler. The real questions you should bear in mind are: "How robust is my Java Virtual Machine?" and "How robust is my own code?". Remember: you will no longer be writing feeble client code. You will now have the means to actually write server code. It's the way objected orientation was intended all along; but it's certainly not for wimps.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#000080"><P>You said Prevayler is open-source software. Do you mean it's free?</P>
</B></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>That's right. It's licensed under the Lesser General Public License.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#000080"><P>But what if I'm emotionally attached to my database?</P>
</B></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>For many applications, prevalence is a much faster, much cheaper and much simpler way of preserving your objects for future generations. Of course, there will be all sorts of excuses to hang on to "ye olde database", but at least now there is an option.</P>
